    <!--Within the <style> tags, some CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is included to style the elements on the page. 
    For example, the body is styled to use the Arial font, and the #character-list is set to display its child elements 
    in a flexible layout that wraps onto the next line if there isn't enough space.-->
    <!--The .character class adds a border, margin, padding, and width to each character's container, and ensures that 
    images inside these containers do not exceed their width.-->
    <!--The #character-details is given a top margin to space it from the content above.-->
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
